# Job-matcher-search
A reverse job board app that helps recruiters find verifiable top talent fast
# Reverse Job Search Platform (Project Placeholder Name)

## 🚀 About the Project
This is a reverse job search platform designed to flip the traditional job-hunting model. Instead of job seekers searching through job posts, **employers search for qualified, actively available candidates**.

## 💡 Problem It Solves
- Job seekers often apply into the void, never hearing back.
- Recruiters waste hours sifting through unqualified resumes.
- Traditional platforms are noisy and inefficient for both parties.

## 🎯 Key Features (Planned)
- Recruiter dashboard with filters and AI-powered candidate suggestions
- Job seeker profiles showcasing skills, certifications, and availability
- Instant connection requests from employers to talent
- Skill-tagging and smart matching algorithm
- Privacy-first design for job seekers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)
- **Frontend**: React / Next.js (or low-code MVP for faster iteration)
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express or Firebase
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Cloud**: Azure or AWS (you’ll deploy infrastructure via ARM/Bicep as your skills grow)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 📌 Goals
- Learn and showcase Azure infrastructure automation
- Demonstrate product ownership and lean MVP development
- Build a live portfolio project that bridges tech and career impact

## 🔧 Current Status
This is an early-phase project focused on defining scope, tech architecture, and user flow before development.
